## 🔍 Grammar Notes

1. "a very happy person" → 관사 `a` 빠진 부분 추가
2. "an English teacher" → 모음 앞엔 `an` 사용
3. "kindly" → 형용사 자리에는 `kind` 사용 (부사 ❌)
4. "a bad guy" → 관사 `a` 추가 + 표현 자연스럽게 다듬음
5. `She`는 문장 시작이므로 대문자
6. `You're`와 `How` 대문자 + 감탄문이 아니라 의문문이므로 `?` 사용
7. 복수 주어 `colors` → 대명사 `they`로 받고 `make`로 동사 일치
8. 단수 `bed` → 복수 `beds` (These는 복수)
